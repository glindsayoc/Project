                This is a file knife. It's common for bladesmiths to warm up by reforging
                an old broken file or some other piece of scrap. This one won't go through
                all the finishing processes of one of the custom knives, but it will eventually
                get heat-treated with a small batch of others like it and have a simple handle
                added.

                 Work-In-Progress: <br />
                This knife is a lot smaller than the others, and when it's done it
                will be a pendant knife that can be worn as jewelry. I'm happy with
                the basic design of the handle, but I'm going to re-cast it because
                there are a few details I want to change, and because there are a 
                few process flaws I don't want to try to fix. When it's finished, the 
                handle will have a two-tone patina of green for the leaves and vines 
                with a brown background. The sheath will also be a casting, styled to
                look like a flower with partially open sides to show the blade, and a 
                locking mechanism with a camouflaged release button.

                This blade was made from a very high-quality steel
                and when polished will have a beautiful wavy heat-treat line. Handle 
                materials are bone, maple burl, and antler tip. After everything is 
                fitted and shaped, I'll add some carving and probably an oil finish.

                    This suspended fire pit was made for the SCA house I belong to. It's expandable 
                    from two pans to three, allowing a few more people to sit around them when needed. 
                    This was so popular with the guests who stopped by that I'm now making more and 
                    selling them.

                    I don't always use a hammer when working with metal. The hooks on the fence 
                    were the starting designs for a friend in Hawaii who grows orchids and wanted 
                    something special to hang the pots from. The ones she grows are all air 
                    plants, so the pots are light and the copper wire worked well and looked nice.
                    <br /><br />
                    The little box was a trinket gift that started out as a mini Altoids tin which 
                    I stripped the paint off of, etched a raised design into, then added an old-style 
                    copper acid-plating and a gun-bluing patina accent.

                    This door-knocker was a fun project, and I have some matching door handles 
                    I'm getting ready to cast. The three alloys used were all ones I developed 
                    myself.
                    <br /><br />
                    The thing that looks like a Rorschach test is just a free-pour of an alloy 
                    I was working on and saved because it looked interesting. I ended up using
                    that same alloy recipe for the tongue-ring of the door knocker, because it had a 
                    high melt-point which was needed to be able to cast the tongue around it.
