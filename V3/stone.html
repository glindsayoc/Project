                    I really enjoy cutting open a rock and deciding how it should be sliced to 
                    bring out the most interesting features. This tiger's-eye had been compressed 
                    and warped, so I cut it at a 90 degree angle from what I usually would and 
                    gave it a high dome, which brought out the lightning-bolt effect instead of a 
                    cat's-eye. These are being paired with moonstone for a necklace.

                    These stones all prettier than they appear in the pictures. It might be a good 
                    summer project for me to learn more about photographing small shiny things and get 
                    the right kind of lighting so I can do a better job with it. I went through about 
                    two hundred really bad pictures, just to have a few for this page's content. 
                    The agatized jasper here looks like painted porcelain with an almost liquid gloss 
                    in real life, but I don't think I captured any of that in this picture.
                    <br /><br />
                    My favorites here are the four matched jasper stones at the top. They've got a nice 
                    flow visually and some funky colors, and they're cut slightly assymetrical to go with 
                    the organic look of the settings they're going into.

                    Opals are one of the stones I most enjoy working with. The pink stones are rhodochrosite 
                    and there's a better shot of the agatized jasper and a not-so-good shot of a rainbow 
                    obsidian at the bottom right, but the rest are all different kinds of opal. Even the 
                    intarsia butterfly wings have a paper-thin layer of opal sandwiched between the quartz 
                    glass cap and the colored stone underneath, and depending on the light and angle, it 
                    ranges from invisible to adding bright flashes of color. The wings are where I tried to 
                    put the image map link, but it shifted a bit to the right for some reason.
