                I really enjoy cutting open a rock and deciding how it should be sliced to 
                bring out the most interesting features. This tiger's-eye had been compressed 
                and warped, so I cut it at a 90 degree angle from what I usually would and 
                gave it a high dome, which brought out the lightning-bolt effect instead of a 
                cat's-eye. These are being paired with moonstone for a necklace.

                These stones are all prettier than they appear in the pictures. It might be a good 
                summer project for me to learn more about photographing small shiny things and get 
                the right kind of lighting so I can do a better job with it. I went through about 
                two hundred really bad pictures, just to have a few for this page's content. 
                The agatized jasper here looks like painted porcelain with an almost liquid gloss 
                in real life, but I don't think I captured any of that in this picture.
                <br /><br />
                My favorites here are the four matched jasper stones at the top. They've got a nice 
                flow visually and some funky colors, and they're cut slightly assymetrical to go with 
                the organic look of the settings they're going into.

            <blockquote>
                Opals are one of the stones I most enjoy working with. The pink stones are rhodochrosite 
                and there's a better shot of the agatized jasper and a not-so-good shot of a rainbow 
                obsidian at the bottom right, but the rest are all different kinds of opal. Even the 
                intarsia butterfly wings have a paper-thin layer of opal sandwiched between the quartz 
                glass cap and the colored stone underneath, and depending on the light and angle, it 
                ranges from invisible to adding bright flashes of color. The wings are where I tried to 
                put the image map link, but it shifted a bit to the right for some reason.

                I've only done a few faceted stones because I don't have all the equipment to do them 
                properly. 
                <br /><br />
                I do have enough to do intarsia though, and I enjoy the challenges of matching 
                pieces of stone and planning all of the cuts needed for a particular effect.
