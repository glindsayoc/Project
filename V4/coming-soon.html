                This is a file knife. It's common for bladesmiths to warm up by reforging
                an old broken file or some other piece of scrap. This one won't go through
                all the finishing processes of one of the custom knives, but it will eventually
                get heat-treated with a small batch of others like it and have a simple handle
                added.

                 Work-In-Progress: <br />
                This knife is a lot smaller than the others, and when it's done it
                will be a pendant knife that can be worn as jewelry. I'm happy with
                the basic design of the handle, but I'm going to re-cast it because
                there are a few details I want to change, and because there are a 
                few process flaws I don't want to try to fix. When it's finished, the 
                handle will have a two-tone patina of green for the leaves and vines 
                with a brown background. The sheath will also be a casting, styled to
                look like a flower with partially open sides to show the blade, and a 
                locking mechanism with a camouflaged release button.

                This blade was made from a very high-quality steel
                and when polished will have a beautiful wavy heat-treat line. Handle 
                materials are bone, maple burl, and antler tip. After everything is 
                fitted and shaped, I'll add some carving and probably an oil finish.

                I really enjoy cutting open a rock and deciding how it should be sliced to 
                bring out the most interesting features. This tiger's-eye had been compressed 
                and warped, so I cut it at a 90 degree angle from what I usually would and 
                gave it a high dome, which brought out the lightning-bolt effect instead of a 
                cat's-eye. These are being paired with moonstone for a necklace.

                This suspended fire pit was made for the SCA house I belong to. It's expandable 
                from two pans to three, allowing a few more people to sit around them when needed. 
                This was so popular with the guests who stopped by that I'm now making more and 
                selling them.
